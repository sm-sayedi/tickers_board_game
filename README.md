# Tickers
Tickers is an android board game, that is played on a 3x3, 4x4, or 5x5 cells board. Tickers is an imaginary name for this game, which originally is played on the ground surface in Afghanistan's rural areas. In this project, I tried my best to mimic the game, by using complex math for game rules. This game is fully implemented without the help of any particular package. It can be played vs. friend or vs. Computer (AI). 

Although the game is not developed to the end, but still it's a good one.ðŸ˜€
